My journey started in high school in a small rural town in Wyoming. The year was 1979. The class was ‘Carpentry and Construction’ and most students entered the class only as a way to secure an easy grade or fulfill the requirements of graduation. I on the other hand quickly took to the subject matter at hand and learned things that would become the foundation of my career.</p><p class="bio">After apprenticeships in Oregon and California, the 80’s became my training ground for my own business. In 1991 I secured my contractor’s license and I was on my way. I have been involved primarily with residential remodelling and room additions. I love to see the transformation of an outdated kitchen or bathroom into a modern look that is specifically crafted to please the needs and the eye of the owner. I have been able to participate in the beautification of many homes including complete interior and exterior renovations.</p><p class="bio">I have been located in the Long Beach area for over 25 years though often find myself in orange county or the south bay working on a project referred to me from a previous client. I am the husband of one wife and the father of four children and have put my roots down here in southern California. My family and faith have been the anchor in my home and business as I continue to keep God at the center of my life. My heart is aligned with the Psalmist who said “Unless the Lord builds the house, they labor in vain who build it”, and this applies to my family and business</p></div></div><div class="container three-points-bio"><div class="row bio-names"><div class="col-md-4"><p><i class="fa fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i> Create</p><p class="mini-bios-description">Creating your dream space, the project isn't done until you're satisfied.</p></div><div class="col-md-4"><p><i class="fa fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i> Build</p><p class="mini-bios-description">Building relationships, a family man with integrity you can trust.</p></div><div class="col-md-4"><p><i class="fa fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i> Serve</p><p class="mini-bios-description">Serving the community of Long Beach and the surrounding Southern California area for over 25 years.</p></div></div></div><div class="footer"><h5>Royce Flom Construction | 2017</h5><p><a href="https://www2.cslb.ca.gov/onlineservices/CheckLicenseII/LicenseDetail.aspx?LicNum=631965">Contractor's License: #631965</a></p><p>Created by <a href="http://gabriellaflom.com">g.flom</a></p><div class="social"><ul class="social-icons"><li class="fa-stack fa-lg"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzkZYOlpXkjWjjge7lwmG1Q"><i class="fa fa-circle-thin fa-stack-2x"></i> <i class="fa fa-youtube-play fa-stack-1x"></i></a></li><li class="fa-stack fa-lg"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/vikingflom/"><i class="fa fa-circle-thin fa-stack-2x"></i> <i class="fa fa-instagram fa-stack-1x"></i></a></li><li class="fa-stack fa-lg"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/royce-flom-a6a2361a/"><i class="fa fa-circle-thin fa-stack-2x"></i> <i class="fa fa-linkedin fa-stack-1x"></i></a></li></ul></div></div><script>!function(e,t,a,n,c,o){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=n,e[n]||(e[n]=function(){(e[n].q=e[n].q||[]).push(arguments)}),e[n].l=+new Date,c=t.createElement(a),o=t.getElementsByTagName(a)[0],c.src="https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js",o.parentNode.insertBefore(c,o)}(window,document,"script","ga"),ga("create","UA-XXXXX-X"),ga("send","pageview")</script><script src="scripts/vendor.js"></script><script src="scripts/plugins.js"></script><script src="scripts/main.js"></script></body></html>
